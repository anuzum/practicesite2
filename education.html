  <h2>Previous Education</h2>
  <p id="first-paragraph">My education journey has been a bit long and circuitous, but it has made me the person I am today! I am grateful to be in school again.</p>
  <h2>Education Journey Continued</h2>
  <p>I earned my bachelor of arts degree at The College of William and Mary, and while I started out wanting to major in English, I ended up majoring in psychology with a minor in sociology. I then earned my master of arts and educational specialist degrees in counseling psychology from James Madison University. I am now back to English, my original passion and interest, and am happy to be pursuing my graduate degree <a href="https://english.gmu.edu/programs/la-ma-engl-lit" target="_blank">in English literature</a> at George Mason University.</p>
