  <h3>About Me</h3>
 
  <p>I live in Vienna, VA with my two daughters and husband. We used to have a black lab, but he passed away several months ago. His name was Milo and he was the best dog in the world. Somehow, my children have convinced me to get another dog. We have to get a hypoallergenic dog this time because my youngest daughter and my husband have a low-level dog allergy. My daughter never exhibited symptoms around our black lab because he was older than both of my children and she was desensitized to his allergens.</p>

  <p>When I am not working full time as an Editor for a government contractor, I am most likely either doing schoolwork for my graduate degree or carting my children around to their sports and activities.</p>
