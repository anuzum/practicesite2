  <h1 id="fancy-title"><b>EXPERIENCE</b></h1>
  <h2>Beginning (Phase 1)</h2>
  <p id="first-paragraph">I started out my career in psychology research. After earning my first graduate degree, I worked in the field of counseling, specifically with the foster care community.</p>
  <h2>Middle (Phase 2)</h2>
  <p>I then took a career break when I had my children. I quit my job during my maternity leave. Something about becoming a parent made me feel brave enough to want to take risks and think about what I really, truly wanted to do. During my time as a stay-at-home parent, I took on various volunteer roles in which I pursued what I love: writing and editing.</p> 
  
  <p>While volunteering and reflecting during my career break, I realized what my ultimate goal was: to return to the field of English, work as a writer/editor, and pursue a graduate degree in English Literature.</p>
  <h2>Current (Phase 3)</h2>
  <p>I did debate about whether to go back to school full-time and earn my graduate degree first before going back to work, but I decided to get a job first and then pursue the degree. Because of that decision, I am now busier than I have ever been in my life and barely have time... <em>ever</em>. This has made me extremely intentional with my time and helped me prioritize the things that matter the most to me. Part of this journey has been quitting social media--in doing so, I gave myself hours of my day back and realized I had the capacity to instead prioritize activities that bring my life value and meaning. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6AF_aFuD8w" target="_blank">Here's a video</a> about the perks of not using social media in case you are interested!</p>
