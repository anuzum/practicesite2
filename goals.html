  <h2 class="sparkly-text">Short-Term Goals</h2>
  <p id="first-paragraph">For my <em>very</em> short-term goals, I'd like to:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Figure out HTML and CSS</li>
    <li>Finish this course successfully</li>
    <li>Create a website for my kids for fun!</li>
  </ul>
  <p>My current short-term goals are to continue to work full time as an editor for a government contractor while I finish my master's degree in English literature. Given that I am taking one class at a time, this may take me until the summer or fall of 2027.</p>
  <p>In my current professional role, I aim to continue to polish and develop advanced editing techniques and skills while taking on challenging proposals and tasks. I hope to be growing professionally within my organization and taking on additional responsibilities.</p>

	<h2 class="sparkly-text">Long-Term Goals</h2>
	<p>Long term, my vision is to continue to write so that one day, I can publish a book. I am currently workshopping ideas and have several ideas for children's and young adult books.</p>
	<p>In order to make this goal a reality and not just something I have been talking about for decades, <em>I need to carve out more time to write daily</em>. It is difficult to work on this goal because I feel that my <a href="#shorttermgoals">short term goals</a> are taking up all of my time. I found <a href="https://medium.com/@penguinrandomus/how-to-write-a-novel-and-keep-your-day-job-2cd9b520fe0" target="_blank">this article</a> about writing regularly to complete a novel very helpful and hope to apply these suggestions. </p>
	<p>I also began writing a novel in my Novel class that I took in the Spring of 2024 with Professor Ngalabak, and I hope to continue writing that as well. I hope I do not add that to my pile of unfinished writing.</p>
